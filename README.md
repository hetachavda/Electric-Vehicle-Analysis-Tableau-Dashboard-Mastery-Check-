# âš¡ Electric Vehicle Analysis â€“ Tableau Dashboard (Mastery Check )  

**Course:** CPSC600-3 Data Visualization  
**Tool:** Tableau  
**Dataset:** Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Registration Dataset  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores **electric vehicle (EV) adoption patterns** across manufacturers, models, years, and locations using Tableau. Dashboards provide insights into **electric range, eligibility for clean fuel programs, and market composition (BEV vs. PHEV)**.  

The analysis highlights:  
- Manufacturer-wise electric range contributions  
- Vehicle model/year distribution  
- Geographic distribution of EVs across North America  
- Eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle programs  
- Composition of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Dashboards & Visuals  

### 1. Vehicles by Make/Model/Year  
- Tesla, Toyota, and Volvo dominate the EV landscape.  
- Strong growth trend observed in **Model Year 2020+**, especially for Tesla Model 3, Y, and Toyota Prius Prime.  
- New entrants like **Rivian** and **Lucid** visible in recent years.  

---

### 2. Electric Range by Manufacturer  
- **VinFast** shows the highest electric range contributions due to aggregated reporting.  
- Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi Outlander also stand out among popular manufacturers.  
- Electric ranges vary widely, reflecting different market positioning (long-range luxury vs. city commuting).  

---

### 3. BEV vs PHEV Distribution  
- **BEVs (9,150)** significantly outnumber **PHEVs (5,642)**.  
- Indicates stronger market adoption of **fully electric vehicles**.  
- Policy and incentive programs likely driving BEV dominance.  

---

### 4. CAFV Eligibility Counts  
- **6,933 vehicles** with eligibility unknown (data quality issue).  
- **4,902 vehicles** marked eligible under CAFV.  
- Transparency in eligibility reporting is critical for policy planning.  

---

### 5. Map by City  
- EV adoption highest in **California, Washington, New York, and British Columbia**.  
- Major urban hubs (Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco, Toronto) dominate.  
- Eastern Canada shows growing penetration of EVs in urban centers.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Insights & Key Findings  
1. **Market Leaders:** Tesla, Toyota, and Volvo lead in adoption.  
2. **EV Range Gap:** Long-range BEVs (Tesla, VinFast) contrast sharply with short-range city EVs.  
3. **Policy Gaps:** CAFV eligibility reporting inconsistent â†’ may affect funding programs.  
4. **Geographic Trends:** West Coast & Northeast US are strong EV adoption zones; Canada urban clusters follow.  
5. **Future Growth:** BEVs gaining dominance; PHEV adoption plateauing.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion  
This Tableau project demonstrates how **data visualization** helps uncover trends in **electric vehicle adoption, range, and policy readiness**.  
With cleaner eligibility reporting and expanded BEV infrastructure, EV adoption is set to accelerate further.
